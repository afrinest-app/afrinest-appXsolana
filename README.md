Afrinest is a next-generation campus platform that turns universities into self-sustaining digital communities by merging connection, commerce, and opportunity in one place.

Students can find jobs or talent through the Campus Job Board, rent or list hostels and apartments within their school community, and buy or sell goods via the integrated Marketplace.

Powered by Web3, Afrinest ensures secure identity, transparent interactions, and decentralized growth, empowering students to build wealth, reputation, and networksâ€”all starting from campus.
